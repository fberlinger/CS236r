# Near-optimal Payments for Ecosystem Services
Payments for ecosystem services (PES) offer compensation to landholders to preserve instead of develop their land, such that everyone benefits from the positive externalities such as clean air and fresh water. Ideally, payment models should be designed to maximize the total societal benefit of PES, i.e., the positive externalities minus the foregone development turnovers for landholders. Optimization is complicated by complementarity effects, which create additional value when land is preserved together. The combinatorial problem size render existing approaches intractable. Assuming knowledge of landholdersâ€™ costs from an auction mechanism, we introduce a novel graph representation for PES, in which nodes hold landholder costs and preservation values, and edges represent complementarities. We offer a graph-search algorithm to find near-optimal preservation schemes in polynomial time, recuperating up to 85% of optimal preservation. We expect such algorithms to become a reliable and flexible tool for dynamic decision-making for PES.
